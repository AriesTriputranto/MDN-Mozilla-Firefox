## Agenda / Notes

1. Logistics for the group
	* We will be using Google Hangouts
	* The Group will have Bi-weekly calls
	* Slack either/or mailing list?: 
	    * Consensus to use both Slack and the Mailing list: 
	        * Slack for discussion threads
	        * Mailing list for announcements, agendaâ€™s next call etc. Not for discussions.
	* Edited version of this notes will be held [on Github](https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/advisory_group_meeting_notes.md) for public consumption 
	    * Claudio + Simeon to handle this
	    * No direct involvement required from other advisory group members
	    * [Chatham House rules](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule) apply
	        * our decisions/advice will be public
	        * our internal discussions may be private
    * Agreed to the possibility of having Off the Record (OTR) conversations.

	* New [Network Strategy page](https://creativecommons.org/about/global-affiliate-network/network-strategy/) and [PDF](https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GlobalNetworkStrategy-Final.pdf) for better reference. Changes [on GitHub](https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/GlobalNetworkStrategy-Final.md). 
	* Broad timeframes to be adjusted while we are doing

3. Platforms update
	* We have 4 platforms so far:
	    * [GLAM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19hFvtDFPZU-FHWmnXaLX5TP9eR7h_Iou-6Cc4Wl6qAM/edit#heading=h.z6uzddh99vqg) - Scann
	    * [Copyright Reform](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dag0KnmSZ0kUm3jf5CWhGm-jmkXBszzLxN5l8trigtk/edit?usp=sharing) - Tim Vollmer, Delia Browne, Paul Keller 
	    * Community Development. [Outline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KaqPonAvmtocxV27qqbQ7YEBBDWr-VVOodHW3f98eSU/edit#heading=h.qs3v279ckoby) - Kelsey Wiens Merkley + Claudio Ruiz
	    * [Open Education](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-HPog_7pPUXrECzne1t6X7eKwo8TzpYBZ8iC8FfASoE/edit) - Cable Green
	* Platforms  / working groups (legal, communications)
	* Discussion over a document called *Decision making process*: 
	    * Guidelines for platform leads and members
	    * Open for comments by Platform leads
	* Set up stage of Platforms is aimed to create a structure for participation. Later, when that structure is done trigger the need of broader participation, with clear paths.

4. The Global Network transition
	* Discussion around the Charter ([see Strategy](https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/GlobalNetworkStrategy-Final.md#membership-and-partnership)). Agreement with the community. Beta version, needs to be polished, but more or less is this. Please include contributions (more than comments) to it. 
	    * There will be another *legal* optional document with the trademark agreement.
	    * Document open for contributions of the Committee until 21st July 2017.
	* The platform. We are testing [BuddyPress](https://buddypress.org/). Intranet. Insiders/outsiders.
	    * Basic idea is to identify and connect with other affiliates. Open to both CC members and the general public
    * Currently in testing
    * Won't be a social network :)
