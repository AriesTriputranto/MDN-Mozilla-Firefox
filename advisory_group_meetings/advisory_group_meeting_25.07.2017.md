**Agenda / Notes**

1. [Membership Charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1addlx0IwGIxAkul_QvkQgL5zkL0X3ru-Bm7roxjKXds/edit#).

	* Objective of the doc: illustrate what GN members can and can’t do.
    * Discussion around members of the Network / Members of the Chapter
    * Proposal: Create a separate document to develop this concept
	    * We should have a sister document that explains how the chapter should / could work
	    * Chapter specific items should be in a separate document but they should be referenced in the charter
	    * Need for a document that outlines steps to take in order to transform former country teams into chapters (compatible with the new Global Network Strategy)
            * e.g. Elect a rep to the GNC, Choose a Public Lead, Have at least one meeting in a given period etc
    * Responsibilities / Enforcement: TBD. 
        * Better word instead of enforcement needed. 
    * Who’s responsible for enforcing?
	    * Keep it lightweight but very clear
	    * Claudio can write a first draft and share a version with Transition Group
	* New polished version will be ready this week. 
	* Legal trademark document prioritized by legal. Call this week.
		* Claudio will get clarity from Diane and Sarah later this week.

2. Platforms: 
* [Decision making process document](https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/Platforms-Guidelines-for-decision-making.md). Version agreed by Platform leaders. Ready to be public.
    * If you have any comments please ping Claudio off list or on the Slack Channel

3. *BuddyPress*. No updates so far bc Rob’s vacations last week. It’s a priority.

4. Working with Communications to offer a xx.creativecommons.org space for Chapters.
	* Not compulsory. Those who would like it will have it.
	* PK: make it compulsory
    * List of advantages/disadvantages

5. Claudio is leading some work to connect with actual Affiliates or former CC related people we would like to see included on this new strategy. Ideas?
