**Agenda / Notes**

1. *State of the art* for **memberships**. Website
	* We are late on the timeline on this
	* Today we will have a working version of the website
		* If good enough we will open this up to the Transition Advisory Group to test and file and bugs and errors
	* Final domain for the website: http://network.creativecommons.org
2. **Charter**. It’s in translation. Ready in weeks.
	* Reviewed by Diane and Sarah and finalized. Most changes are language changes
	* Translations: Arabic, French and Spanish
	* We’ve asked some people to read and review the translations to check if the final version is good enough when they are ready - in a matter of weeks
	* We will open membership even though the translations aren’t ready
3. **Mini-guide for Vouching / Mini Guide for approval**. Check new version
	* Idea behind this document is to provide a guideline for vouching
	* It is not a list of prescriptive requirements - it’s a guide
	* What does success look like? Numbers or something else?
	* Tomo: CC should be more than the licenses. The idea is to have more people identify and contribute with the movement. Have a global distribution of the movement.
	* Meredith: I know this is a delicate balance, but I think we need to have an option for people who want to be supporters and contributors without becoming a member.  (Platforms, Chapters, and the General List?)
		- 		Explain in a central place different ways to engage. 
		- 		Include this in all major comms pieces
		- 		What is the pipeline to participation? I.e. ways to get started
		- 		Having a lot of ways to come in: is how we get people excited!
4. Some Affiliates reactions
	* Many affiliates responding to comms with questions and clarifications. Most feedback is supportive and very constructive
	* Some cases feeling “left out”
	* Idea of having Q & / FAQ to anticipate some of the criticisms
5. Discussion: New Chapters. Role of the Affiliates to organize local chapters?
	* Chapter guidance doc (structure of non member participation), what are the ways to express who should join as a member (participating member vs. friends of CC)  [MJ]
