The Creative Commons Global Network Council (the "GNC" or the “Council) establishes the Executive Committee (the “Committee”) for the purpose of leading the work of the GNC, to act in the stead of the GNC between meetings, and to undertake such other activities as may be delegated to it by the GNC.

### Organization

1. The Committee shall consist of nine (9) members. The Committee shall consist of the CEO of Creative Commons, two staff members appointed by Creative Commons, and six representatives elected from the GNC ("Council Representatives"), one of whom shall be the Chair of the GNC unless such individual is also a member appointed by Creative Commons to serve on the Committee. The Chair of the GNC shall serve as Chair of the Committee until such time, if any, as the Committee elects another or resigns.

2. All members of the Executive Committee shall have voting rights on matters within its purview.

3. The Secretary of the GNC shall act as Secretary of the Committee, and shall schedule meetings  and ensure meeting records are properly maintained.

4. The term of Committee members shall be two years. One-half of the Committee members shall be appointed annually for open positions at the Annual Meeting of the Council. The Committee is responsible for determining the initial staggering of terms.The Members are elected in their individual capacities, and will serve their full term even if a Chapter replaces its GNC Representative prior to the conclusion of their term; provided, however, that the Committee member must remain a member of the CCGN.

5. The Committee shall meet as necessary but shall strive to do so no less than quarterly. The Committee shall meet at least one month in advance of the Annual Meeting, which shall take place in Q4 of each calendar year, to plan and establish an agenda.

Meetings may take place in one or more sessions to accommodate time zones of Committee members, provided the same agenda is presented at each session, and notes summarizing any recommendations are made available to all eligible participants from the meetings.

6. The Committee may adopt rules of procedure provided they are not inconsistent with any established by the GNC for the conduct of the Committee.

7. Decisions of the Committee shall be made by consensus when possible. All Committee members shall be entitled to vote on all matters brought before the Committee for official decision when a consensus is not reached. A majority of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for conducting business at any meeting, and the act of a majority of Committee members present at any meeting will be deemed the act of the Committee.
