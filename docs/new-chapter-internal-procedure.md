## Internal Procedure to be followed when a new CC Chapter is formally organized

A new chapter is deemed to be formally organized when the Network Manager receives the minutes of the First Chapter Meeting.
At this point, the following procedure shall follow:

## Step 1:

* Set the Permissions for the file to "Anyone with the link can view"

## Step 2

* Create a GSuite Group Mailing List for the chapter [here](https://groups.google.com/a/creativecommons.org)
* Update the [CCGN Canonical Tracking Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TVska58E8G21ejjQwo8KxWAF10p90c-AIfQQsgM8ewg/edit?usp=sharing) by adding the names and email addresses of the elected officials in the 'Chapters' tab.

## Step 3

* Add the Representative to the Global Network Council to the [Global Network Council mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/creativecommons.org/forum/#!forum/global-network-council) and the [GNC Group on Slack](https://creativecommons.slack.com/messages/GHFG7P6F8)

	* Link to active Social Media (Twitter preferably)
	* Link to the minutes of First Chapter Meeting
