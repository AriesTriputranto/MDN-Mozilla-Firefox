# Regarding CC staff, contractor and Board member involvement in Chapters and the Network

Purpose of this policy: The purpose of this policy is to provide rules and guidelines for CC staff, contractor, and board members on their relationship with Chapters and the Global Network to foster a healthy, vibrant, active network and support Chapters’ ability to act with local leadership.

CC staff, contractors, and Board members are welcome to participate in Chapters, platforms, and other areas of work of the CC Global Network. This policy is designed to inform them, as well as the CC Global Network, of how these persons may engage with the CCGN given our goals described below.

The Global Network design is open and big enough to support broad participation by everyone with an interest and commitment to CC’s values and mission. This includes staff, contractors, and Board members. This said, we recognize that the influence, opinions, and power (real or perceived) that a staff person, contractor, or Board member may have in any particular forum could undermine the goals of encouraging new participants to speak up, voice opinions that may challenge established views of the network or CC, and assume leadership positions. The CC and the CC Global Network seek a diversity of views, new thinking, and new leaders. We also recognize, on the other hand, that in some countries staff, contractors and Board members may play essential roles, especially at the beginning stages of a Chapter’s formation.

We still further recognize the potential for a conflict of interest to arise when a staff member, contractor, or Board member engages in these fora. Whether such conflicts are real or perceived makes no difference. The involvement of these individuals can also create a power dynamic, given that CC HQ holds the final say on funding allocations, has insights and access into its internal workings, pays individuals to work on CC issues full time, and holds three seats on the CC Global Council Executive Committee, which runs the Global Network Council.  

All of these factors taken together have led CC to establish a code of conduct for staff, contractors and Board members when they are involved in the CC Global Network and its various fora. This policy supplements the policies applicable to staff ([here](https://teamspace.creativecommons.org/img_auth.php/c/c1/US_Handbook_March_2018.pdf)) and Board members ([here](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/9/91/Creative_Commons_Code_of_Conduct_for_Directors_and_Officers_%28adopted_Mar_4_2018%29.pdf)).

Therefore:

1. CC staff, contractors and Board members are encouraged to apply to be members of the Global Network and will be approved/voted on as members subject to the same criteria as all other members (i.e., there's no automatic approval just because a person has been hired, engaged or appointed to a position at CC), but if they wish to participate without seeking membership that is encouraged as well;
2. In so participating either as a member or participant, they are also encouraged to participate actively as such; however,
3. CC staff, contractors and Board members cannot vote for the representative or lead (nor may they serve in either capacity), and may not assume or be appointed, as a leader of programs, activities, campaigns and similar without an exception having been granted by the CC Chapter, their manager, and HQ; and
4. CC staff, contractors and Board members must be mindful that Chapters are independent of CC HQ, when participating they should take care not to undermine that independence, not to dominate the conversation or decision-making process, should actively support new voices and new leaders in the country, and abide by conflicts of interest policies applicable to their general involvement in Chapters and other fora, including with respect to those who may be viewed as indirectly having influence as described above due to their relationship with a staff member, contractor, or Board member. 

Staff members, contractors, and Board members should ask the CEO, the Director of Ecosystem Strategy, or the General Counsel if they have any questions about this policy.

Effective: June 18th, 2018.
